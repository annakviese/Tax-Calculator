# TFSA vs RRSP Calculator 

This calculator was created to compare TFSA and RRSP contributions. 
A "user" will have to manually input the values in order to get the result. 

## Technology Used 
Since it is my first independent Angular 2 app, I've used the angular quickstart suggested by CodeSchool (https://github.com/angular/quickstart)

* Angular 2
* TypeScript
* HTML5
* JavaScript 

## To run the app 

* Download the zip file
* Unzip the file and access it via your Git
* run "npm install" (to install the necessary node modules)
* run "npm start" (to load the file in a separate window)

## Improvements 

Due to time constrains the app does not provide the best user experience and requires some improvements:
* Allow users to enter full numbers and convert to the percentages automatically
* Provide a select option values for some entries
* Apply additional form validation (max.rate, max.deposit etc.)
* Add styles to emphasize results
* Change screens when getting results
